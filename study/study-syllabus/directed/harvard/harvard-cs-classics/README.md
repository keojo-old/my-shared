# Overview
The concept for this was inspired by Harry Lewis's class Computer Science Classics. In the class students are assigned papers that set the foundation for the field of computer scientist and would discuss them in-person each week. This site allows for a more in-depth discussion outside of the classroom.

The hope is that by seeing each others highlights, notes, and thoughts on particular parts, it will drive a more conversation and perspectives, which will lead to a more engaging dialog during class.

## Getting Started

1. Go to [localastronaut.github.io/harvard-cs-classics](https://localastronaut.github.io/harvard-cs-classics)
2. Select a paper to collaborate on
3. Sign up for a free [Hypothesis](https://hypothes.is) account to save your notes

# Paper Locations
Since many of the papers are hosted in embedded viewers, it was not possible to have all of them be embedded and available for annotation.

If the host were to change the file directory it would no longer recognize the url and the file would no longer be available.

A paper may not be available in PDF format which could cause issues.

This required the papers to be converted and hosted on the server.

PDF allows the papers to keep special characters and preserving the images in the locations they were originally.

# Annotations
The annotations run on h, an open-source annotation framework by the non-profit group Hypothesis.

You will need to sign up for a free account in order to save your annotations.

You can post highlights and annotations to either public or private.

There is an option to create a separate group from the public that may be more fitting for each classroom.

## Preparing the papers using Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
Many papers were written before computers existed and only available through physical books. This requires them to be scanned and converted to a PDF. However, an additional step is required in order to annotate the text. This is a process called Optical Character Recognition which converts the print into machine encoded text.

# Contributing
### Adding Papers
All papers are stored as PDFs in the '/papers' folder. If you have an paper you would like to add or update, you can add do it here.

### Updating Paper Information
There is a master .JSON file that stores all of the information that is used for the populating the page. It can be accessed at '/data.json'. If you want to update information about a paper, you can do it here.

### Making the site better
You are highly encouraged to add any features that could improve the site. It was originally designed for simple collaboration on computer science papers. If there is a better way to structure, organize, or optimize the site, you are encouraged to do it.

Submit a pull request and the site moderator will approve any edits that improve the information or structure of the site.
